# canvas-manipulation
 created by following Chris Courses youtube channel tutorial.
 
 can be found in this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxljFhP2krI.
 
the project is interactive canvas - the canvas has circles moving all around, bouncing from the window edges.

Also, when a circle is close to the mouse it enlarges and when it is far it is resize back to its initial size.
